            <p>At the 2004 Gun Show in Las Vegas, USA on February 11,
                HK displayed a series of carbine guns collectively known as "HKM4".
                This weapon is actually a modification of the M16 series rifles.
                The HKM4 development program began in 2002. When HK improved the British SA80

                it began to evaluate the technical feasibility of improving M16 series carbine guns in early 2002.
                The purpose of the study was to improve the reliability and service life of M16 series weapons.</p>

                HK416 is characterized by maintaining strong firepower while maintaining the stability of guns.
                The intake system of HK416 assault rifle ensures that propellant gas and residue do not enter the
                interior of the gun body, reduces the influence of dirt on the gun, and improves the reliability of
                the weapon. The HK416 barrel has a long life and can fire 20,000 rounds of ammunition with little
                reduction in accuracy. In addition, the gun is not afraid of flooding or dry climate.

                To improve the service life, HK manufactures four kinds of cold forged barrels of different lengths,
                including 10, 14.5, 16.5 and 20 inches, with high quality European steel.
                The barrel life is more than 20,000 rounds, and there are four kinds of barrels of different lengths.
                In addition, a new buffer device is used to improve the reliability and safety of the weapon.
                In addition, more reliable magazines have been manufactured.

            <p>
                Since Colt intended to sue HK for infringement of their rights in 2004,
                HK abandoned the name HKM4 and renamed it HK416. HK416 was officially launched in February 2005.
                At the same time, a new structure of Picatini rail guard was adopted,
                which made the appearance of HK416 more distinct from the original M16/M4.

                At 2300 hours on May 1, 2011, Afghan local time, 24 "Seals" commandos from the commando unit,
                accompanied by two "Black Hawk" helicopters and four other "Chinook" helicopters,
                went to bin Laden's hiding place. During the operation, one "Black Hawk" fell for unknown reasons.
                But ultimately, Razor No. 1 and Razor No. 2 cooperated tacitly and killed bin Laden with HK416 in two shots.
