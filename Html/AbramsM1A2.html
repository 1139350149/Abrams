            Initial M1 and M1 armored modified M1IP used 51 times diameter 105mm rifle gun equipped with M68A1 as main gun.
            M1 first entered the battlefield through Saudi Arabia in the 1991 Gulf War and outperformed its rivals, Iraq,
            in terms of performance, with Soviet-made T-72, T-62 and T-55.</p>

                In the second stage of 11 prototype vehicle tests, problems occurred in the air filter system,
                transmission device, crawler and fuel supply system of gas turbines. In the second half of 1979,
                three XM1 vehicles were modified, and the tests proved that most of the problems were solved.
                Among them, the main problems are the crawler falling off and the engine inhaling dust.
                The former problem is solved by redesigning and adjusting the structure
                of the moving and suspension parts.

            <p>The latter problem is to install reliable seals in the filter system.<br/>
                But It still has some shortcomings : Its crawler life is 1100-1500km,
                which can not meet the operational requirements.And XT158H track is being tested and tested.

                In the First Gulf War, Abrams achieved fame for the victory of one single battle.
                The ratio of loss to war between the two sides is 0:1000.
                (Although most of the enemy troops were destroyed by the air forceThough,
                M1's loss of 0 is still astonishing.In this war, the M1 tank group forces defeated the enemy's trump card, the Republican Guard.)
