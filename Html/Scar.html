            </div>
            <p>The bidding requirement of Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) is to
                replace M16/M4 with a newly designed modular weapon,
                which can replace three kinds of barrels of different lengths and change caliber types
                 in a very short time according to different purposes.</p>

                FN SCAR rifle is designed on the basis of FN FNC assault rifle.
                FN FNC assault rifle and its Swedish cousin Ak-5 assault rifle have been used for
                many years and show excellent reliability in jungle, desert and polar environment.
                Because FN FNC and Ak-5 are based on AK operating system, that is to say,
                they may have higher reliability in dirt, mud, sand and other extreme environments.
                The problem is that FN FNC pins are said to break prematurely.

                According to some new data, it is known that the hit rate of SCAR-L STD is 70% for the point target of
                500 meters and the area target of 600 meters, and 70% for the point target of 600 meters and the area
                target of 800 meters. As for the reliability of SCAR, neither users nor manufacturers have officially
                announced. However, in August 2007, the U.S. Army began to conduct sand-dust comparative tests on M4,
                Mk16 SCAR-L, HK416 and XM8. The test results were published, with XM8, which had been cut off,
                ranking first, and SCAR, which had a much lower failure rate than M4, ranking second.

            <p>
                In some armies, a standard infantry class will be equipped with a variety of individual equipment,
                but in rifles they are collectively equipped with Scar series rifles
                , because Scar can replace the barrel characteristics,
                so that it can not only perform CQC operations, medium-range firefighting
                , but also play the role of precision pistol shooting.
