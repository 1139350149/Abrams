            <p>In 1988, Colt commissioned the U.S. Department of Army to develop a new M16 carbine gun with the
                joint participation of the Department of Army and the Marine Corps. Colt's engineers shortened
                the barrel to 14.5 inches (370 mm). A neck was added to the barrel to mount the M203 grenade launcher.
                The barrel was retractable with a semi-automatic and three-shot shooting mode. Double-layer aluminium
                heat shield was used in the shield.In 1982, the U.S. Marine Corps began to use M16A2 rifles
                (contracted by FN at that time) and M855 ammunition to replace the old M16A1 and M193 ammunition.
                Force Recon in 1983, in response to the adoption of new ammunition, proposed the need for indoor close combat weapons
                , which is to replace XM177E1/E2 and part of M16A1 carbine gun XM4 program.</p>

            <p>
                The main difference between M4 and M4A1 is that M4 has a "S-1-3" system (insurance/single/three-point) trigger
                , while M4A1 has a "S-1-F" system (insurance/single/automatic) trigger with fixed handle.
                Its butt can be used as a close-up weapon, equivalent to a knife.In response to the improvement of
                USSOCOM, the U.S. Army also changed the original M4 into rough timber and flat top casing.
                The improved model 920 in Colt and modular Weapon System based on SOPMOD were developed.

                M4 carbine gun has a shorter guard, 368.3 mm long barrel, about 140 mm shorter than M16A2.
                The butt is a sliding retractable butt. When the butt is pulled out,
                shoulder-to-shoulder shooting can be used. When the butt retracts,
                waist shooting can be carried out. M4 straps are different from M16A2/A4 straps,
                which are connected below the gun but on the side of the weapon,
                so that soldiers can easily be ready to shoot while patrolling with guns.

                Model 635 (or RO635) submachine gun is a 9mm Parabellum submachine gun based on M16A2.
                Now Colt's business names are RO635 (automatic) and RO639 (point shooting),
                also known as Colt SMG (Colt submachine gun), some people call it Colt 9mm.

                The AR-15(AR comes from Armalite instead of Assault Rifle) was designed by Eugene Stoner of Fairwood Amalet Company on the basis of the 7.62mm AR-10.
                AR-15 has been developed as a lightweight model based on AR-10 using 5.56 mm bullets. But it still is
                the member of M4 Family, just like M16. It is hailed as the pioneer of small caliber gun.
                AR-15 was gradually purchased by the U.S. military, but it was named M16.
                However, Colt still uses the AR-15 trademark in the semi-automatic model
                (AR-15, AR-15A2) of the gun provided to the public and law enforcement buyers.

                M4 as a sharp edge in the hands of the U.S. Army, it joined most of the War in which the United
                States participated since 1991.
